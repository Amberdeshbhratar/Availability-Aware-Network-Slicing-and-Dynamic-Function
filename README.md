# Availability-Aware-Network-Slicing-and-Dynamic-Function

**SliAvailRAN** (Availability-Aware Slicing and Adaptive Function Placement in Virtualized RANs using Reinforcement Learning) is a reinforcement learning-based framework that optimizes network slicing and function placement in virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRANs). This project addresses challenges in 5G networks such as high reliability, scalability, and efficient resource utilization using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).

## 🧠 Features

- 📡 Availability-Aware Network Slicing with disjoint primary/backup paths
- 🔄 Dynamic CU/DU function placement based on live resource availability
- 🧠 Reinforcement Learning with PPO (via Stable-Baselines3)
- ⚠️ Constraint-aware decision making (latency, bandwidth, wavelength continuity)
- 📈 Scalable to large topologies (up to 128 nodes)
